This repository contains code and files for a 'home doctor' application; an app where you can select a bodypart where you ache and answer a range of questions about it. The app then gives you a most likely diagnose along with an advice. The application is made in XCode with the SwiftUI language.

The app includes screens for selecting a bodypart and answering a question, as well as a screen for the diagnose. Furthermore we have a map screen where general practitioners near your current location are displayed, and a history screen where you will find diagnoses you previously saved, and by clicking them you will again see the diagnose and the advice.

The app makes use of the GPS module of your device, and uses Core Data to store and retrieve diagnoses you saved in the application. The components of the app are spaced using GeometryReader, so the app should be usable on every generation of iPhone.
